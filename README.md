# Group 25 - Jass Game

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build an application which allows multiple users to play the popular Swiss card game “Jass”. These include registering/logging in as a player, adding friends, creating or joining games, playing different modes of Jass on global or private tables and using the chat functionality to communicate with friends and opponents during the game. Overall the aim is to create a playable “Jass” game, with a playing atmosphere similar to the real world. The external API should be implemented by enabling the user to login with their Google account and use their Google profile picture as an avatar.

## Technologies
